# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple tic tac toe game played in the terminal implemented in Node.js using 'prompt-sync' for user input. 

## How to play?
- Two players get to choose what emoji they want to play as.
- they take turns, placing their marks on a 3 x 3 board with numbers ranging from 0 to 8 until one wins or game ends in a draw.
- once game ends in either a win or a draw, the user is prompted if they want to play again.
- if yes, the game resents the playing board and if not, the game stops.
